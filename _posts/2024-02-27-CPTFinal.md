Summary of CPT Project
----------------------

My group and I focused on creating an engaging travel page for anyone to interact with. We incorporated a homepage with cards that, when clicked, redirect you to the actual games. We have several features, including memory games, trivia, and a leaderboard where scores are stored and tracked.

My Feature
----------

During this project, I worked with the frontend. Specifically, I coded a memory matching game using world flag emojis. In the initial live review, I worked on adding different inputs and buttons to change the difficulty (easy, medium, and hard). I have also been exploring animation techniques to make the page more aesthetically pleasing. (This is seen with the cards flipping over when clicked as well as with the fade in/out animations when someone hovers over the game cards.) Over this time period, I have also helped with the modern/simple theme in our webpage to further enhance the look. Recently, I have worked to incorporate a leaderboard that interacts with our backend. When users sign up, their information is stored, and they are eligible for having their scores/rank displayed publicly.

CPT Requirements
----------------

| CPT Requirements | Explanation |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data stream, a file. | Each of our features has some form of input. My feature, a memory matching game, has user interaction with buttons to adjust the difficulty of each game. |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose. | An example of a collection of data can be seen with our leaderboard, which allows us to publish the scores of the user. |
| At least one procedure that contributed to the programâ€™s intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters: |<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vv4r7nv/Screenshot-2024-02-27-at-8-02-06-PM.png" alt=""> |
| Instructions for output based on input | The code automatically checks if the cards match, and decides whether or not to flip them over. The score is then updated in increments of 10. |
