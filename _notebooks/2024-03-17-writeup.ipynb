The inclusion of db.create_all() suggests an initialization process that might be better suited elsewhere in the application. Additionally, the placeholder for user_id signals an intention to link tasks to users, indicating a multi-user setup. Upon successful creation of the task, it reads and returns the newly created task data with an HTTP 201 status code, indicating that a new resource was created.

    "The JavaScript function getAllTasks is using the Fetch API to make a GET request to a specified URL (apiUrl). It sends the request with the header indicating that the content type expected is JSON, and it sets a CORS policy to allow any origin (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'). Once the fetch promise resolves, it checks if the response was successful (response.ok). If not, it throws an error. For a successful response, it converts the response body to JSON format. This JSON is expected to be an array of task objects. After that, it logs the tasks to the console and also updates the inner HTML of an element with the ID 'result' on the webpage, displaying the formatted JSON data. If there's an error at any stage, such as a network issue or a problem with the request, it catches the error and logs a failure message while also updating the 'result' element with a failure message. This function is set to be called when the document is fully loaded, ensuring that the task list is fetched and ready to be displayed as soon as the user can interact with the page.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- I set up the code to handle task management efficiently. First, I implemented sorting functionality in the sortTasks function that organizes tasks based on priority. This makes it easier to see what needs to be tackled first. When a new task is added via the form, I stop the default submission with event.preventDefault(), and then check to make sure both the task name and description fields are filled out. For the task display, I create a new div element for each task, format the details into a string, and set it as the innerHTML of a child div. I also add a remove button with an event listener for task deletion. This task element is then appended to the DOM, making it visible on the page immediately. Additionally, I've got functions to handle API calls for fetching all tasks and updating existing tasks, updating the page content dynamically based on the API responses. This setup avoids page reloads and keeps the user interface snappy. Overall, the JavaScript I crafted manages the tasks dynamically and keeps the UI updates smooth and responsive.\n",

    "  <p>Linear regression is a basic yet powerful algorithm used in statistics and machine learning to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It seeks to establish a linear relationship between the input(s) and the output. In its simplest form, known as simple linear regression, it models the relationship between two variables as a straight line (y = mx + c), where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope of the line, and c is the y-intercept. When multiple independent variables are involved, the method is called multiple linear regression, which extends this idea into higher dimensions, attempting to fit a multidimensional plane to the data points. The core objective in both cases is to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed values and those predicted by the model, a method known as least squares.</p>"

Starting from the root node, which encompasses the entire dataset, the algorithm splits the data into homogeneous subsets through a series of decision nodes, each representing a condition on certain features. This splitting continues until it reaches the leaf nodes, which represent the final outcomes or decisions. Pruning is also an integral part of the process, involving the removal of sub-nodes to avoid overfitting and to improve the model's generalization capabilities. The aim is to create a model that clearly delineates the path from conditions to conclusions, making it intuitive and easy to interpret."
