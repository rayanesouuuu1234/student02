Exemplar in Team work.

Throughout the second trimester, my group and I functioned coherently. Before each project/assignment, we would communicate verbally to generate ideas/plans to succeed. In our CPT project, for example, we took the time to allocate specific jobs to each person. We agreed that each of us would create a game online and integrate a scoring system (leaderboard) that would interact with all of the games. We also created a discord server to communicate with each other outside of school hours. Whenever we were stuck on an issue and couldn't work it out together, we branched out towards friends in higher level classes or to our peers. In terms of learning, I enjoyed NATM projects, especially by the CSA students. It was interesting to see high level programming at work, and it motivates me to achieve the same.
